This is a friendly kaggle learning, the dataset is clean and easy to understand.

1. Do some exploratory study in R notebook, the url is  [Exploratory study in forest types with R](https://www.kaggle.com/gukai1212/exploratory-study-in-forest-types-with-r)

2. Simply clean features and predict the results with some ML, the python notebook is [First formal kaggle competition: Classify forest](https://www.kaggle.com/gukai1212/first-formal-kaggle-competition-classify-forest)


#### A common task in machine learning pipelines is encoding categorical variables for a given algorithm in a format that allows as much useful signal as possible to be captured.
